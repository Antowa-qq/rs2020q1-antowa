Hello , today I want to tell you a little about React.
### 2 slide
React is developed and created by Facebook, Instagram and a community of individual developers and corporations.
React can be used to develop single-page and mobile applications. Its goal is to provide high speed,simplicity and scalability. React is often used with other libraries such as Redux and GraphQL.
### 3 slide
At the moment, a lot of projects have been done with React.
Most popular are facebook, Instagram , Netflix , WhatsApp и and other sites
### 4 slide
What is React?
 It Is a JavaScripts library for building user interfaces, but this is not a framework like Angular, vue, ember and so on.
React provides the perfect tool for creating scalable applications.
React uses View from MVC Pattern.
### 5 slide
Virtual Dom in React
Manipulate DOM is high cost, so  React uses the virtual DOM. The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM.
### 6 slide
JSX in React 
This slide shows a simple example of using JSX.
This is not a line, this is not a fragment HTML.
This is JSX - an extension of the JavaScript language. It is recommended that you use it when you need to explain to React what the UI should look like. JSX is reminiscent of a template language endowed with the power of JavaScript. JSX produces React “elements”. JSX makes writing code easier. 
### 7 slide
Components in React
Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation, they accept arbitrary inputs (called "props") and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.
You can create a component using a function or ES6 classes.
### 8 slide
Component – props
Props is what you pass into the Component via attributes.
Props is the only way to input data. (Or you can use Redux).
Props are immutable.
Container component will define data that can be changed
Child Component will receive data from parent component via props.
### 9 slide
Component – state
Private data of component 
When change going on re render Component
Can`t read from outside Component
### 10 slide
Life cycle component
component life cycle can be divided into 3 parts :
Mouting
Updating
Unmouting
### 11 slide     	
Mouting
These methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM:
### 12 slide
Updating
An update can be caused by changes to props or state. These methods are called in the following order when a component is being re-rendered: 
### 13 slide
Unmouting
This method is called when a component is being removed from the DOM:
### 15 slide
React hooks
They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.
### 16 slide
Pros and cons of React js
### 17 slide
Pros
React js is extremely efficient(because uses Virtual DOM)
It makes writing JavaScript easier ( because React js uses a special syntax called JSX)
It gives you out of the box developer tools  (React js chrome extension)
It's awesome for SEO( server rendering)
Ui Test Cases
### 18 slide
cons
React.js is only a view layer
There is a learning curve for beginners who are new to web development.
 Library size  is comparable with angular’s
### 18 slide
Why you should use React js?
React.js works great for teams, strongly enforcing UI and workflow patterns.
The user interface code is readable and maintainable. 
Componentized UI is the future of web development, and you need to start doing it now.
And also, there is now a lot of demand for developers with React JS experience.
### 19 slide
So, we can talk for a while about React, but I think that it should be enough for today. Have a nice day. Bye.
